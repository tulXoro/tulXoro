![Welcome, Tim's Github](./profile/images/gh-header.png)

I'm Software Engineer! I'm passionate about problem solving and software development! My hobbies include watching anime and playing video games. If I'm not doing either of those, I'm probably reading web novels or manga/manhwa/manhua/webcomics.

Most of my repositories are private, but I do have some listed as public. I like to keep things organized, so you will notice a lot of [**archived**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) repositories. Like the status implies, I've archived them because they are projects/programs that are no longer being maintained. If you have any questions about any of them, please reach out to me.
