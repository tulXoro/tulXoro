# Welcome!

## My Github

I like to keep things organized, so you will notice a lot of [**archived**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) repositories. Like the status implies, I've archived them because they are projects/programs that are no longer being maintained. If you have any questions about any of them, please reach out to me.

## Biography

I am a Software Engineer that loves to code! I build out small programs and projects.

### Hobbies

I like watching anime and playing video games. If I'm not doing either of those, I'm probably reading web novels or manga/manhwa/manhua/webcomics. As I like programming, I also like to design and build projects!
